# CoinCounter
A C++ program to split any amount to coins &amp; notes.

Just enter amount and get **all** possible coin & note combinations that give you that exact amount.
This might require a huge amount of computational resources for a larger amount.

## Editing `denominations`:

I've set the `denominations` array to match the current Indian system. You can change them whatever values you like, as long as the array is sorted in **descending** order. That is ABSOLUTELY necessary for this program to function properly.

This program was built over the weekend as hobbyist project. So its nowhere near perfect. Contributions regarding efficiency & memory optimization are highly welcome! But PLEASE don't spam it with: "Edit denominations array." ;)
